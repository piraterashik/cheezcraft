## cheezcraft
a very bare minimum recipe app ðŸ§€

since this was a primitive attempt, i wanted to restrict myself to a limited array of recipes. 
therefore the cheese-based recipes. 
the idea was: 7 new recipes (focused around cheese, don't ask why) would be released every week.
one new dish for each day of the week. 

### accomplished: 

- **homescreen** containing the recipe buttons (each containing within itself a _like_ button and _prep time_ for each dish)
- the **recipe** page containing the _ingredients_ and _prep details_ (and some pretty awful puns)
- a **profile** page containing all the recipes the user likes from said week 
- a **navigation panel** on the bottom of the screen, constant throughout the app

### future update ideas  :

- user gets to rank their favorite cheese types (in profile)

- 'premium' version of the app (behind a paywall obviously $$$) curates a separate roster of dishes based on user's favorite cheese(s) from the rankings

- user reviews on each dish for the week, with the option to add their image of the cooked food

- a separate button showcasing the most popular (ie most liked recipe across all users) of the week

- a shopping list (add-to-cart button within the recipe page) which would show up on user's profile

## attention: to anyone intending to run the app, run 'npm i' before 'ng serve' to run the app
