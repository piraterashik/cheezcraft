##cheezcraft
a very bare minimum recipe app ðŸ§€

since this was a primitive attempt, i wanted to restrict myself to a limited array of recipes. 
therefore the cheese-based recipes. 
the idea was: 7 new recipes (focused around cheese, duh) would be released every week
one dish for each day of the week. 

3 screens in total

- homescreen containing the recipe buttons (each containing within itself a like button and text that shows the prep time for each dish)
- the recipe page containing the ingredients and prep details (and some pretty awful puns)
- a profile page containing all the recipes the user likes from said week 

some ideas for future updates  :

- user gets to rank their favorite cheese types (in profile)

- 'premium' version of the app (behind a paywall obviously $$$) curates a separate roster of dishes based on user's favorite cheese(s) from the rankings

- user reviews on each dish for the week, with the option to add their image of the cooked food

- a separate button showcasing the most popular (ie most liked recipe across all users) of the week

- a shopping list (add-to-cart button within the recipe page) which would show up on user's profile
